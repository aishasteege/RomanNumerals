# RomanNumerals

All files in /googletest are not my own and used in conjunction with the /googletest/LICENSE

BUILD
	use the makefile to make all
	
RUN
	main - run the converter
	RomanNumeralTests - run the tests
	
FUTURE WORK
	- NumeralConverter should be split into 2 classes for each type of conversion
	- The tests then also split into 2 files
	- the ui is not very robust, a lot more work should be put into handling the 
	  errors (returned as empty strings and zero for the conversion)
